    "Over the lest month or so my homelab server has been rebooting unexpectedly. This started shortly after I began using influxdb to collect metrics from the host system, but disabling that has not resolved the problem. After rebooting, I noticed for the first time a machine check exception (MCE) is logged in the system journal. It happened again today, thus this post.\n",

    "I burned this SSD out by using it for [ZFS L2ARC](https://www.truenas.com/docs/references/l2arc/) for the better part of a year. I suspect write amplification may have given it an early demise, but I simply disabled l2arc and moved on with life. The drive's read performance is now relatrively bad (~50 MB/sec) and writes to it eventually lead to errors like `Buffer I/O error on dev sdb, logical block 6402, lost async page write`, aka \"it's dead, Jim\".
