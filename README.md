Welcome, this is the source code for [my site](https://www.tbeck.io).

This is a migration from my [old site](https://github.com/tmbeck/mlp) as fastpages is no longer maintained. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is the suggested replacement.

# Publishing Workflow

1. Modify, commit, and sync changes to `main`.
2. Run `quarto publish gh-pages`
3. Wait for [page to load](https://www.tbeck.io) (might need to force-refresh for updates to show)
