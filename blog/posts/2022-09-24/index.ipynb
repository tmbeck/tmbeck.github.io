The serial console didn't even show output from grub, so there was either a significant hardware problem or the bootloader had somehow become corrupted. I tried power cycling it several times but it would never boot. Finally I replaced the Mellanox card with an old video card so I could see what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apparently during a previous power cycle the LSI Megaraid 9260-8i card had an unclean shutdown and was not able to flush its write cache. The card decided to let me know by prompting me to press any key to continue or to press 'C' to enter the configuration utiltiy. The prompt is a one time event (per occurrence, I'm sure), so after pressing spacebar and verifying grub came up, I tested that grub would come up after a reboot, then restored the Mellanox card. The system booted up fine after that.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cache data was lost due to an unexpected power-off or reboot during a write operation, but the adapter has recovered. This could be due to a memory problem, bad battery, or you may not have a bettery installed.\n",

    "```\n",

    "Recently the LSI card had a [BBU-iBBU08 battery pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PGZ1R12) installed, but I removed it when I noticed significant bulging on the side of the battery pack. I bought the battery pack three years ago so it had a good run."
